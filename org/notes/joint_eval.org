#+TITLE: Joint Eval

* Notes
  - met with jasper 6/27 about offline perception
    - offline perception already used with planner eval (vegetation)
    - track detection coming soon. classification not on roadmap
    - will add offline labels to normal ground-truth label database
    - recommends adding offline localization, which he got working fullstack
  - met with william 6/27
    - talk w/ oracle team about viz
      - possible jupyter notebooks suffice. stakeholders to consult?
    - talk w/ ryan about ops resources
    - offline localization may have intricacies about keeping commits consistent
    - can also joint eval on:
      - open-loop vs closed-loop sim
      - log vs synthtic
        - synthetic_converter_job.py can convert logs to synthetic configs
  - met with william 6/14
    - ndf structure is list of references to topic paths (blob v2)
      - could maybe even cache perception topics for scenes?
    - simulator_main should have config to redirect topic paths
    - could also write new binary that uses BlobWriter
