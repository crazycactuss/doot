#+TITLE: iTerm2 + Zsh Research

* Terminal Research
  - terminal latency comparison https://danluu.com/term-latency/
    - terminal.app is fastest
    - iterm2 is slow
    - alacritty is pretty good
    - kitty is not on here, but seems to be pretty fast as well
  - alacritty is designed for tmux (no native scrollback)
  - google: alacritty vs kitty
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/n9noje/alacritty_vs_kitty/
      - kitty seems to have better features (e.g.: font ligatures, scrollback)
      - alacritty is on windows. kitty is not (not sure if it matters)
      - alacritty seems to be slightly faster
  - https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728
    - terminal.app doesn’t have true color. try awk test
    - iterm2 and alacritty pass. alacritty doesn’t pass in tmux. iterm2 does
  - alacritty doesn’t really support option as meta…
