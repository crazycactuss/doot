https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mdMEQ9eZImczhUpWiUazPxRbVaUz5VBaThStB9vp718/edit
- robot frame
  - position and orientation centered on rear axle of nurobot
- global
  - latitude, longitude, and altitude in WGS-84
  - routes won't be smooth (due to precision?)
  - orientation in radians counterclockwise from east
- smooth
  - 0,0 defined as robot starting point. position is found by integrating velocity
  - robot will have smooth trajectory
  - yaw is counterclockwise from +x axis
