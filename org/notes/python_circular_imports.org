- CONCLUSION:
  - tend to use import modules not classes/functions directly. this will work as long as you don't
    call anything at the top-level (or extend classes, which will resolve base classes at the top-level)
  - i want to avoid deferred imports and using the "TYPE_CHECKING" conditional import
