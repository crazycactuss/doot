   - https://gitent.corp.nuro.team/Nuro-ai/Nuro/pull/90972
     - why "exclude first lane in the traversal from this rule"? in other words, if the track is
       right up against a different intersection, it's okay to consider it possibly cross-traffic?
   - https://gitent.corp.nuro.team/Nuro-ai/Nuro/pull/91662
     - does lead vehicle have to be same lane? what about parallel adjacent lane?
   - "double-counting could lead to impossible values of exposure to different agent types"
     - a vehicle can't be both lead and cross-traffic. but if it was, what does "impossible" mean
       here?
   - unit tests?

       output metric
** IDLE write technical plan for BK (after merging MVP + designing rest of branches)

     - don't like how BK moves data around. API is finnicky (artifacts or flat meta-data), and
       coordinating deployments of updates is risky with multiple consumers
     - modularity promoted through code, not deployments
** IDLE integrate with BQ simtest triage table

   - SUMMARY:
     - reproduced the index via index_one_log. inspected the
       *track_world_state.track_ground_truth.track_ground_truth_events*. printed component ego and
       agent angles and confirmed that they were offset 180deg (i.e.: pi radians) in the events
     - went to confirm that the raw comms messages had the same angles
       - in the video, NB is moving in the +x direction in smooth coordinates, so i assume its yaw
         is correct
       - track 12 has a correct orientation of -90deg in smooth
       - track 96 has correct orientation of -90deg
       - cyclist has incorrect orientation
     - relevant files
       - relevance_events_view_util.cc uses ego and track samplers supplied from
         track_relevance_events_view.cc
       - ego sampler from ego_pose_info_view.cc
         - gets pose data from pose_view.cc#AllPoses. this is populated in
           pose_view.cc#UpdateInternalState from the pose topic
         - ego sampler interpolates between poses in ego_pose_sampler.cc#GetPoseXYT, which calls
           pose_accessor.cc#GetInterpolatedTransform3
         - transform3.h has a constructor of Transform3 that uses the pose pitch, roll, and yaw to
           create a rotation matrix. uses Transform3::Interpolate to interpolate between them
         - in onboard/comms/proto/pose.proto, see that the pitch, roll, and yaw are in smooth
           coordinates
       - track sampler from
         - gets data from track.cc#QueryState and then track.cc#QueryStateOrShape, which
           interpolates between Track::track_states_ via track_state.cc#Interpolate
         - track_states_ is populated in the Track constructor using the TrackState constructor from
           the raw DetectedObjectsMessage proto message from track_view.cc#UpdateInternalState
         - nested in the DetectedObjectsMessage, as seen in onboard/comms/proto/track_state.proto,
           see that the SplineStateProto orientation is in smooth coordinates
     - perception team said that incorrectly reversed orientation is a known issue
     - to more robustly address helen's issue, should introduce different field *ego_to_agent_dyaw*
       that compares yaws (i.e.: direction of travel) instead of orientations (i.e.: direction
       facing)

  - reported again: https://jira.nuro.team/browse/TII-2322
  - reported again: https://jira.nuro.team/browse/TII-2345
  - CONCLUSION: 2 types of root causes
    - actual duplicate block ID due to multiple writers to the same SHM topic
    - published to frequently to SHM topic. IDs wrap around before old ones are evicted. should
      adjust topic_buffer_duration
    - on indexing side, only warn for duplicate block IDs. in principle, there shouldn't be a
      problem
    - lingering Q: why not matching "free" warnings for TII-2322?

   - see how filter affects scenarios w/ legitimate bad nudges? what is the frequency response of
     legitimate bad nudges?
   - to address startup artifacts, can we try extending the initial values of velocity? (is
     butterworth FIR?)

    - met with jasper 6/27
      - early termination of sim CDM was causing lack of metrics for some scenes
      - shouldn't change sim config (i.e.: specify variant). the collision_eval sim job should by
        default use the config originally used for each log, so i shouldn't change that by
        specifying the variant (previously use 15mph_srp)
        - however, technically the variant shouldn't really affect anything since collision_eval
          doesn't resim behavior, but may cause some noisy signals w/ srp contours. srp also uses
          the srp bot model in NV, which is confusing

   - [X] try writing concurrent topic iterators in label converter
     - are timestamps interleaved in blob in strictly increasing order? YES
     - CONCLUSION: it works. diffed first 10k lines of DO topic echo for old and new. exactly the
       same.

     - https://stackoverflow.com/c/nuro/questions/1974/why-need-both-pub-sub-topic-and-shm-topic-for-pose
     - when to use fromloggedsimpose vs fromloggedsimposering?
     - when is sim_vehicle_pose used? there are two topics pose and sim_vehicle_pose with the Pose
       message type.
       - therefore, not correct to use has_pose to look for pose topic as done in the current label
         converter
       - https://stackoverflow.com/c/nuro/questions/790/how-does-simmed-vehicle-pose-work
         - sim vehicle pose comes from SimulatedDbwModule (which runs in post_ngm)
       - perception uses onroad pose
     - [X] confirm that sim_vehicle_pose doesn't exist after pre_mhtc and appears after post_ngm
       - look at random metrics job (critical category):
         http://bates.corp.nuro.team/tasks/simtest/48m12rhn/_/subtasks
       - CONCLUSION: confirmed that there was only pose after pre_mhtc. mhtc is the stage before
         post_ngm. still no sim_vehicle_pose, but there were others (e.g.:
         mh_prediction_output_sensor_pose). after post_ngm, sim_vehicle_pose finally appeared

       - //servers/borg/batch_simulation
         - just submits simtest requests. can connect to local launcher
       - //simulation/framework/batch_simulation/bates/launcher
         - top-level launcher for simtests, but still uses cloud executors
   - [X] test sim module in BATES (perception_quick with metrics override)
     - 39rwwlo5 - test on origin/green_simtests (via UI). should expect no GT stage
     - muetgt3t - test w/o metrics_config change (via UI). GT stage is always enabled in
       metrics_job, so it should appear
     - z6kr9c0g - test with metrics_config change (via UI). should expect no GT stage
     - o4267k5v - test with metrics_config change (via batch_simulation) but disable gt stage
     - 139pofpt - test with metrics_config change (via batch_simulation) and enable gt stage
     - [X] inspect results (compare before/after message timestamps + inspect in NV)

    - the core issue is that router messages use the blob (i.e.: onroad) context map, but downstream
      modules used a more recent context map version
      - seems like there's one more adjacent issue that router messages might've been re-simmed with
        a different CM version and cached. when re-simming on top of the cached router messages,
        then the CM version is different again, which causes issues when LocalMapModule is resimmed
        since it depends on router messages
    - matthewli mentioned that in
      https://gitent.corp.nuro.team/Nuro-ai/Nuro/blob/9a6e658eb9bc035ce869c45dbfdac36dd97e3b43/simulation/framework/batch_simulation/bates/sim_runner.py#L571-L581
      the context map commit is determined, but this is an arg to the sim binary
    - https://gitent.corp.nuro.team/Nuro-ai/Nuro/blob/develop/simulation/framework/batch_simulation/bates/jobs/metrics_job.py#L497
      - i suspect that since index_task is not the sim binary (i.e.: _simulator_task), there's no
        sim config piped to indexing. william left a message in the thread that likely refers to
        this
    - william fixed the issue: https://jira.nuro.team/browse/SW-26448

    - the issue is that the missing feature is a lane (id = 156408927133 at ts 19.0), and when
      ego_context_view tries to use local_map_view to access it, local_map_view returns nothing
    - the context is that ego_context_view is trying to calculate along-route distance to implicit
      ped path (IPP) features. Note that IPP features are not included in the context map. Instead
      they are calculated in the local map (which has a smaller radius). ego_context_view is
      iterating across all IPP features, which come from the local map, and it is able to retrieve
      the intersecting lane as well, which intuitively should be the furthest lane from the bot
      along the way to the IPP feature
    - the problem occurs iterating across lanes along the route to the IPP feature to calculate
      distance, so an intermediate lane is missing from the local map. a reasonable explanation is
      the route turns back towards the bot so this intermediate lane falls outside the local map
      radius. However, lane feature IDs originally come from a router message from the blob, so why
      doesn't it appear in the local map? does the router module not use local map?
    - the problematic lane feature actually does exist in the context map, but it's too far away and
      out of the local map radius
    - michal's fix is to just process IPP features in increasing order of along-route distance from
      the nurobot. this will still ultimately ignore problematic IPP features, but will likely
      ensure more features are processed
    - LocalMapView uses LocalMapAccessor (which is used onboard). it injects into LocalMapAccessor
      with the features of interest, computed in ComputeLocalMap. base features are retrieved from
      ContextMapAccessor, but IPP features are computed using ImplicitPedPathsComputer
      - where are IPP features calculated onboard? how are they used by the router?
      - ImplicitPedPathsComputer used by ImplicitPedPathsCache, used in
        onboard_context_map_utils.cc:ComputeOnboardContextMap
      - ComputeOnboardContextMap used in onboard_context_map_utils.cc:GenerateOnboardContextMap,
        which is used in intermediate_representation.cc:Compute, which is use din
        intermediate_representation.cc:ComputeOnboardContextMap
        - note that IR = intermediate representation and IF = inferred feature
      - intermediate_representation.cc:ComputeOnboardContextMap used in
        context_map_factory.cc:CreateContextMapProto, which is used in context_map_accessor.cc
      - CONCLUSION: seems like accessing the context map onboard already gives access to all IPP
        features. then what reason is there to use local map onboard? does router even use local
        map?
        - local map also contains lane relationships
    - context_map_factory.cc:CreateContextMapProto also used in
      context_map_factory.cc:CreateContextMapMemDb, which is used also used in LocalMapAccessor,
      LocalMapModule, and localization
    - LocalMapAccessor is used throughout onboard code, but NOT router
      - [[https://gitent.corp.nuro.team/Nuro-ai/Nuro/tree/develop/onboard/router][Nuro/onboard/router at develop · Nuro-ai/Nuro]] - router module README. router module is named
        router2_module.cc
      - no router code even subscribes to kLocalMapTopic
    - glean: LocalMapAccessor -> found #local-map slack channel. "Original Design Doc" is linked,
      but it's very old (last updated 2020)
      - [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11fCL9qKP9bbE7ii_UZGvEvaY-W9Gqn9X_TDXm1ucj6I/edit#heading=h.3dpw4xabhnka][Context/Local/Nearby Map Module - Google Docs]] - implies that router may not need to use
        local map
    - tried taking a look on NV at the problematic IPP and lane. the problematic lane seems to be at
      the furthest point that the route reaches out and is roughly the same distance as the
      IPP. seems believable that maybe there's a slight misconfiguration or precision issue with the
      local map radius in indexing? could also be a slight synchronization issue with local map
      messages onboard?
    - CONCLUSION: michal's fix is workable for now. maybe indexing needs to revisit whether to use
      LocalMapView or ContextMapView for lane features that come from router messages. might even be
      a deeper onboard local map issue that needs to be raised with mapping team

    - resim 8zs46pxl because the logs were dropped. new job ID: 0hvua1es
      - index at commit: eae2040330451b1cb18f4bab20175c60a079ef4b
      - viewed in NV. noted SW failover in the middle of the intersection
      - in EgoContextIndexer::Process, printed timestamp with EgoContextView::GetDistanceToIntersection
        - when bot is in the intersection, distance to intersection should be 0. instead, showed a
          lot of inf and some non-zero values (e.g.: at timestamp 5875.34 the distance is 1.12663)
        - inf values come from EgoContextView::GetDistanceToIntersection failing because
          ego_lane_id_ was empty
      - in EgoContextView::GetDistanceToIntersection, printed the ID of the upcoming intersection
        (intersection_id) and the ID of the lane in the intersection (next_lane_id). when they
        match, it means the bot is in the intersection and the distance should be set to 0
        (otherwise it would be the distance to the following intersection)
        - the intersection_id is always correct
        - for the non-zero value inside the intersection, the next_lane_id is incorrect. instead,
          it's somehow set to the previous lane right before the intersection
      - curious how ego_lane_id could be empty
        - in EgoContextView::UpdateInternalState, logged result of
          RouterView::GetRouteLaneAndPos. ego_lane_id is empty because latest router messages are
          invalid.
        - noted that the timestamp for the non-zero value has a successful router message, but the
          previous timestamp has a failed router message.
    - CONCLUSION: handed off to kun. open questions:
      - why is next_lane_id incorrectly set in GetDistanceToIntersection? is it related to invalid
        router messages? would investigate EgoContextView::GetNextIntersection
      - why are some router messages invalid? does it have to do with sw failover? would investigate
        how has_valid_router_ is set and the contents of the invalid router message
      - noted that when indexing with a later commit, saw a lot of "Localization msg is not useable"
        lines from LocalMapAccessor. related?

  - [X] which indexer/fields are relevance events in?
    - relevance events appear multiple times throughout the world state for different combinations
      of ego/track trajectories. most likely interested in either
      track_world_state->...->track_ground_truth or
      ground_truth_track_world_state->...->track_ground_truth
    - both are populated in ground_truth_track_indexer
  - [X] how are relevance events populated in ground_truth_track_indexer?

    - ground_truth_track_world_state->ground_truth_tracks only has newly completed tracks
    - track_world_state->tracks->track_ground_truth has all events across all states of track existence
  - [X] how does track_view work? (how are newly completed tracks determined?)
